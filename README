FTN-Database

Modules and associated scripts which can be used for Fidonet/FTN related processing
in an SQL database supported by a Perl DBD module, defaulting to SQLite, and which
includes FTN Nodelist processing.

Required, neccessary and/or useful modules, etc.:

DBD::SQLite	SQLite DBD Module is required by default, so should be installed.
		Any other database engines will be named similarly and should be
		installed if used.  May	already be installed on your system;  if
		not, one place they may be obtained is at CPAN (www.cpan.org).

FTN::Log	Must be a least v0.02, for the 'logging' subroutine as used in 
		the ftnpldb-nodelist and ftnpldb-admin scripts. If not already
		installed, it can be obtained from CPAN (www.cpan.org) or from
		the ftnpl project at Sourceforge.

Getopt::Std	May already be installed on your system;  if not, one place
		it may be obtained is at CPAN (www.cpan.org).

BBS_CARNIVAL can be used for discussions regarding it as well and are the
preferred avenues for support.
