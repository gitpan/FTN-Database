To Do:

Tentative plan for initial version changes.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.02	FTN::Database - Create create_ftndb subroutine. Move open_ftndb
    and close_ftndb subroutines from scripts.  Also create set_ftndb_acl subroutine?

0.03	FTN::Database::Nodelist - Derive a 'Drop Nodelist Table' subroutine from
    the ftndbadm & nl2db scripts.  Derive a 'Create Nodelist Table' subroutine
    from the ftndbadm script.

0.04	FTN::Database::Nodelist - Derive 'Drop Nodelist Table Index' subroutine
    from nl2db script, naming it drop_ftnnode_index.  Move the Create Nodelist Table
    Index subroutine from ftndbadm script, renameing it as create_ftnnode_index.

0.05	FTN::Database::Nodelist - Derive a subroutine for executing queries on the
    nodelist table from the code used in the net2file subroutine. 

0.06	

0.07	

0.08	

0.09	Documentation updates

0.10	Initial release ?


General
--------

- Update/rewrite/etc comments and documentation as neccesary in all files.

- The option added to define which type of database to use does not currently do
any error checking on that type;  the script will fail if a correct DBD name
is not used.  If do not explicitly do such error or other checking, document the
standard names for DBI DBD modules like SQlite (default), mysql, cvs, & postgresql.  

- The use of special characters like periods in table names is a more general issue
where it is not a good idea to use them at all.  Redo the comments in both scripts
regarding that, to generalize it.


FTN::Database
-------------_
- Create create_ftndb subroutine.
- Move open_ftndb subroutine from scripts.
- Move close_ftndb subroutine from scripts.
- Create set_ftndb_acl subroutine?

FTN::Database::Nodelist
------------------------
- Derive a 'Drop Nodelist Table' subroutine from the ftndbadm & nl2db scripts.
- Derive a 'Create Nodelist Table' subroutine from the ftndbadm script.
- Derive 'Drop Nodelist Table Index' subroutine from nl2db script, possibly
  renaming it.
- Move the Create Nodelist Table Index (create_ftnnode_index) subroutine from
  ftndbadm script.
- Derive a subroutine for executing queries on the nodelist table from the
  code used in the net2file subroutine.
- Move get_nodelist_filename subroutine from nl2db script?
- Possible function/subroutine that checks if a valid nodelist table 
  name is being used?
- Use a different datatype than "TIMESTAMP" for the 'updated' filed in the
  nodelist table?  (Not generic enough?)
  
nl2db
---------
- Script does not seem to properly handle a file that ends in just blank
  lines, instead of content line or a ^Z character.
- When there are multiple nodelists of the same name being processed, the
  script is using just one of them;  but not always the most recent one like
  it should. (get_nodelist_filename subroutine)
- Get quoteing working properly for entry into the database for fields like
  $loc & $name, so do not have to take out characters like single quotes, etc.
- Also need to ensure that LF and/or CR characters at the end of each line do not
  make it into the database as they are ending up in the $flags field.
- Add quiet option, -q, for logging only operation ? 
- Add a test nodelist for use with this?...


ftndbadm
--------
- Add an explicit subroutine to create a database;  it's not needed for sqlite
  databases but it can be for others.
- Add options to create or drop the ftnnode index on the nodelist table.
- Add better error checking.
- Add quiet option, -q, for logging only operation ? 
- Separate out the nodelist related options to a separate ftndb-nl-adm script?


net2file
---------
- Add quiet option, -q, for logging only operation ? 
- Make this just an example script?
