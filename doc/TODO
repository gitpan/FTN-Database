To Do:

General
--------

- The default user and password parameters for an SQLite date is a an empty
  string;  change the default coding for those in the Perl scripts.2

- Redo the variables used in the Perl scripts for readability, including by
separating the words in the variables by underscores.

- Change the $BINDIR variable in the example shell scripts to /usr/local/bin,
as that is where 'make install' puts the Perl scripts on a Linux system.
    
- Update/rewrite/etc comments and documentation as neccesary in all files.

- The option added to define which type of database to use does not currently do
any error checking on that type;  the script will fail if a correct DBD name
is not used.  If do not explicitly do such error or other checking, document the
standard names for DBI DBD modules like SQlite (default), mysql, cvs, & postgresql.  

- The use of special characters like periods in table names is a more general issue
where it is not a good idea to use them at all.  Redo the comments in scripts and
modules regarding that, to generalize it.  (Derive function to validate it and add
that to the FTN::Database module?)

- Add a note in the documentation that the version number in the bin/ Perl scripts
matches up to the oldest version of the modules that they will run with.


FTN::Database
-------------_
- Add an explicit function to create a database, create_ftndb (not explicitly
  needed for default DBD SQLite but it can be for others).  Add function to use
  it, to the ftndbadm program.
- Create set_ftndb_acl subroutine? (Same reasoning as for create_ftndb.)
- Reword SYNOPIS section.


FTN::Database::Nodelist
------------------------
- Derive and move a function for executing queries on the nodelist table from
  the code used in the net2file subroutine. 
- Derive and move function for removing all nodelist table entries for a
  particular domain from the code in bin/nl2fdndb.
- Derive and move function to insert or update an entry from nl2ftndb. Separate
  functions for insert & update, or different options in same function?
- Move get_nodelist_filename subroutine from nl2ftndb script?
- Possible function/subroutine that checks if a valid nodelist table 
  name is being used?
- Use a different datatype than "TIMESTAMP" for the 'updated' filed in the
  nodelist table?  (Not generic enough?)
  
  
nl2ftndb
---------
- Script does not seem to properly handle a file that ends in just blank
  lines, instead of content line or a ^Z character.
- When there are multiple nodelists of the same basename being processed, the
  filelist is being reverse sorted;  that takes care of a set of files all from
  the same year but not ones that are from different years.
  reverse sort on the file list, preferably when getting the file list.
- Get quoteing working properly for entry into the database for fields like
  $loc & $name, so do not have to take out characters like single quotes, etc.
- Also need to ensure that LF and/or CR characters at the end of each line do not
  make it into the database as they are ending up in the $flags field.
- Add quiet option, -q, for logging only operation ? 
- Add a test nodelist for use with this?...


ftndbadm
--------
- Add better error checking.
- Add quiet option, -q, for logging only operation ? 
- Add an explicit function to create a database;  it's not needed for sqlite
  databases but it can be for others.  (See ToDo for FTN:Database)
- Add cammand/options to create or drop the ftnnode index on the nodelist table.?
- Separate out the nodelist related options to a separate ftndb-nl-adm script? May
  not need to if can reorganize it by command.


net2file
---------
- Add quiet option, -q, for logging only operation ? 
- Make this just an example script?  Or generalize the name, like to nl2file & keeping 
  extracting a net as an option along with other extraction options?
