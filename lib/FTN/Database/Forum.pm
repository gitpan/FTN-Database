=head1 EXAMPLES

An example of opening an FTN database, then creating a forum table,
loading data to it, then creating an index on it, and then closing
the database connection:

    use FTN::Database;
    use FTN::Database::Forum;

    my $db_handle = open_ftn_database(\%db_option);
    $fields = define_forum_table();
    create_ftn_table($db_handle, $table_name, $fields);
    ...   (Load data to forum table)
    ftnmsg_index_tables($db_handle, $table_name);
    close_ftn_database($db_handle);
